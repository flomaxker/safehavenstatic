<h2 id="definitions-scope">1. Definitions &amp; Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Data</strong> means any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person (e.g., parent’s name, email;
child’s first name, learning progress).</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> refers to all lesson platforms, coaching
sessions, booking systems, communications, and this website provided by
Safe Haven Dutch Coaching, operated by Florian Kersten (“we”, “us”,
“our”).</li>
</ul>
<p>This policy applies to all students (children aged approximately
6-14, “Students”) and their parents or legal guardians (“Parents,”
“you”) who use my Services.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-collect">2. What I Collect</h2>
<p>We collect information necessary to provide and improve our
Services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parent/Guardian Information:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account &amp; Contact:</strong> Your name, email address,
password (securely hashed), phone number (optional, for urgent contact
or scheduling).</li>
<li><strong>Billing Information:</strong> Information required by Stripe
for payment processing. We do not store your full credit card details on
our servers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Student Information (provided by Parent/Guardian with
consent):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student Profile:</strong> Student’s first name, age or
birthdate (for age-appropriate planning), a pseudonym code (e.g.,
“Student A” for certain internal planning tools), lesson preferences,
and current Dutch language level.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson Notes:</strong> Topic summaries from lessons,
progress assessments, pseudonymized feedback related to learning and
well-being within the coaching context.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Materials:</strong> Worksheets or digital materials
shared or created during sessions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Booking &amp; Payment Information:</strong> Payment records
via Stripe, appointment dates and times, lesson duration.</li>
<li><strong>Communications:</strong> Emails stored on TransIP mail
servers, summaries of important communications (e.g., via our website’s
messaging system if applicable), and pseudonymized chat summaries if AI
tools are used for communication assistance (with your awareness).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-i-use-retain-your-data">3. How I Use &amp; Retain Your
Data</h2>
<p>I only collect and use the data I need to teach effectively, bill
accurately, communicate with you, secure my services, and improve
lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Purposes of Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To create and manage Parent and Student accounts.</li>
<li>To schedule, plan, and deliver personalized coaching sessions.</li>
<li>To process payments for Services via Stripe.</li>
<li>To track Student progress and tailor lesson content.</li>
<li>To communicate with Parents about their child’s progress,
scheduling, and other service-related matters.</li>
<li>To share learning materials.</li>
<li>For AI-assisted lesson planning and content brainstorming using
<strong>pseudonymized data</strong> (see Section 6).</li>
<li>To comply with legal obligations (e.g., Dutch tax law).</li>
<li>To maintain the security of our website and services (e.g., server
logs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Retention Schedule:</strong> Below is how long I keep
each type of data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Student Profiles (including lesson notes):</strong>
Duration of lessons + 2 years (to allow for follow-up questions,
facilitate repeat sessions, and provide continuity in learning).</li>
<li><strong>Stripe Payment Records:</strong> 5 years (to comply with
Dutch tax and accounting regulations).</li>
<li><strong>Pseudonymized AI Transcripts/Inputs (e.g., for ChatGPT,
Google AI Studio used in lesson planning):</strong> 30 days. Key
insights are transferred to my secure, local notes, and the AI chat logs
containing even pseudonymized data are then deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Server Access &amp; Error Logs:</strong> 90 days (for
security monitoring and incident investigation), then auto-deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Full Server Backups (TransIP) &amp; iCloud Snapshots (for
Craft/GoodNotes):</strong> Rolling 30-day rotation; older
backups/snapshots are automatically purged.</li>
<li><strong>Email Correspondence (TransIP):</strong> Retained for the
duration of the active student profile + 2 years, or as long as
necessary for ongoing communication or legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>I automate deletion schedules where technically feasible (e.g., for
server backups and logs) and conduct a quarterly audit of my retention
practices.</p>
<h2 id="childrens-privacy">4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Protecting the privacy of children is fundamental to my Services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> I collect and process Personal
Data about Students only with the explicit, verifiable consent of a
Parent or legal guardian, typically obtained during the booking or
registration process.</li>
<li><strong>Data Minimization for Children:</strong> I only collect
information about Students that is directly relevant and necessary for
providing effective coaching Services (e.g., first name, age for
appropriate lesson planning, learning progress). I actively avoid
collecting unnecessary sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Children’s Data:</strong> A Student’s Personal Data
is used solely for educational purposes: to plan and deliver lessons,
track learning progress, provide feedback to Parents, and ensure a safe
and supportive learning environment.</li>
<li><strong>Parental Rights for Child’s Data:</strong> As a Parent, you
have the right to access, review, correct, or request the deletion of
your child’s Personal Data. You can do this by contacting me.</li>
<li><strong>No Direct Marketing to Children:</strong> I do not use
Student’s Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> I apply the same robust security measures
(detailed in Section 9) to protect Students’ Personal Data as I do for
all Personal Data I process.</li>
<li><strong>AI Tools &amp; Children:</strong> When AI tools are used for
lesson planning, all Student data is strictly pseudonymized, and
sensitive details are excluded (as detailed in Section 6).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="legal-bases-for-processing">5. Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
<p>I process your Personal Data based on the following GDPR legal
grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent:</strong> You (as a Parent) give explicit consent at
the time of booking or registration for the processing of your and your
child’s Personal Data as described in this policy, including consent for
the use of specified third-party data processors. You can withdraw your
consent at any time for future processing, without affecting the
lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
<li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Processing is necessary
to deliver the paid coaching Services you have requested, including
managing bookings, providing lessons, and processing payments.</li>
<li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> I process some data for my
legitimate interests, such as:
<ul>
<li>Improving lesson quality and service effectiveness (e.g., via
analysis of pseudonymized learning patterns from AI tools or internal
review of teaching methods).</li>
<li>Administrative efficiency (e.g., using Clockify for time tracking of
billable hours).</li>
<li>Maintaining the security of my website and services. I have assessed
that these legitimate interests do not override your or your child’s
fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> Processing is necessary to comply
with legal requirements, such as retaining financial records for Dutch
tax law.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="international-data-transfers">7. International Data
Transfers</h2>
<p>Some of the Data Processors I use (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Apple,
Stripe, and potentially Clockify/GoodNotes depending on their
infrastructure) may store or process data outside the European Economic
Area (EEA), primarily in the United States.</p>
<p>When Personal Data is transferred outside the EEA, I ensure that
appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance
with GDPR requirements. These safeguards typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The processor being located in a country deemed by the European
Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection.</li>
<li>The use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the
European Commission.</li>
<li>For transfers to the US, reliance on frameworks like the EU-U.S.
Data Privacy Framework (if the provider is certified) or SCCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about these safeguards in the
respective privacy policies of the Data Processors linked in Section 6.
For AI tools, my primary safeguard is the pseudonymization of any
student-related data before it is processed by non-EEA services.</p>
<h2 id="student-rights-how-to-exercise-them">8. Student Rights &amp; How
to Exercise Them</h2>
<p>Under GDPR, Parents (on behalf of themselves and their Student) have
the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the Personal Data I hold
about you and/or your Student.</li>
<li><strong>Correction (Rectification):</strong> Request updates or
corrections to inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion (Erasure / Right to be Forgotten):</strong> Ask me
to erase Personal Data, unless I am legally required or have an
overriding legitimate interest to keep it (e.g., payment records for tax
law).</li>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong> Receive Personal Data you have
provided to me in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
format, and have the right to transmit that data to another controller
where technically feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Object:</strong> Object to the processing of Personal Data
based on my legitimate interests.</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> Withdraw your consent at any time
for future processing where consent is the legal basis. This will not
affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
withdrawal.</li>
<li><strong>Restrict Processing:</strong> Request the restriction of
processing of Personal Data under certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To exercise any right:</strong> Email me at
<code>florian@safehavendutch.nl</code> with the Subject: <strong>GDPR
Request</strong>. I will verify your identity (to protect your data) and
respond within 30 days (this period may be extended by two further
months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of
requests, in which case I will inform you). There is generally no fee
for exercising these rights, unless requests are manifestly unfounded or
excessive.</p>
<h2 id="security-measures">9. Security Measures</h2>
<p>I take the security of your Personal Data seriously and implement
appropriate technical and organizational measures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Transit:</strong> SSL/TLS certificate via TransIP for all
website traffic, ensuring data is encrypted between your browser and my
server.</li>
<li><strong>At Rest:</strong>
<ul>
<li>MySQL database with table-level encryption enabled on TransIP
servers.</li>
<li>Data stored with third-party cloud services like Apple iCloud and
Google Drive is encrypted by those providers by default.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Strong passwords and restricted
access to backend systems and databases.</li>
<li><strong>Firewall &amp; WAF:</strong> TransIP server-level firewall
active. Exploring Cloudflare free-tier Web Application Firewall (WAF)

<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Weekly review of SSH access logs and
server error logs. Quarterly vulnerability scans planned.</li>
<li><strong>Software Security:</strong> Use of PDO prepared statements
to prevent SQL injection, CSRF tokens on forms, and secure session
management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cookies">10. Cookies</h2>
<p>My custom CMS uses only:</p>
<ul>

<code>PHPSESSID</code>):</strong> Essential for website functionality,
such as logging you into your Parent dashboard. These are HTTPS-only and
are deleted when you close your browser.</li>
<li><strong>CSRF Cookies:</strong> For security to protect forms against
Cross-Site Request Forgery.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do <strong>not</strong> use tracking cookies or local-storage data
