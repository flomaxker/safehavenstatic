                    <p>Hello! I'm Flo Kersten, founder of Safe Haven Dutch Coaching. I have a deep passion for helping expatriate children (Third Culture Kids, or TCKs) not just learn Dutch, but truly feel at home and flourish in their new life in Groningen.</p>
                    <p>Moving to a new country is a big adventure. For children, however, it can also bring unique challenges: making new friends, adapting to a different school system, and figuring out where they fit in while navigating multiple cultures. My mission is to provide a supportive, understanding space where your child can build both their language skills and their crucial sense of belonging.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="slide-up" style="margin-bottom:2rem;">
                <h2>Why I Understand the TCK Journey</h2>
                <p>You might wonder how I connect so deeply with this experience. I've walked a similar path. Having spent parts of my life abroad in places like Kinshasa, Bangkok, and Berlin, I experienced firsthand what it's like to navigate new environments and cultures. When I returned to the Netherlands, I even felt like a foreigner in my own country for a time.</p>
                <p>These experiences didn't just teach me about different cultures; they taught me empathy. They showed me the importance of connection and the deep human need for what I call a "safe haven." I learned that home isn't just a place; it's a feeling of safety, identity, and acceptance. Grounding myself again taught me that building these foundations takes time and understanding &ndash; and that's where my coaching can make a real difference for your child.</p>
                <h2>The Safe Haven Approach: More Than Just Language</h2>
                <p>At Safe Haven Dutch Coaching, my approach revolves around interactive and experiential learning, often taking place in real-world settings right here in Groningen. I aim to be more than just a teacher; I act as a coach and mentor, guiding each child through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Playful Dutch Language Learning:</strong> We make learning Dutch fun and practical, using games, role-play, cultural activities (like baking Dutch cookies!), and even outings to local spots. The focus is on building confidence to speak and understand Dutch in everyday situations &ndash; at school, with friends, or in the neighborhood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emotional Well-being &amp; Identity Support:</strong> I provide a compassionate ear and use age-appropriate coaching techniques to help children process their feelings about relocation, express their unique multicultural identity, and build resilience. This isn't therapy, but a supportive space to navigate the emotional side of adjusting to a new life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Integration:</strong> We explore Dutch culture and school norms in a kid-friendly way, helping children understand their new environment and feel more comfortable and connected to the local community.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>A Welcoming Space for Your Child</h2>
                <p>If your family is settling into Groningen and you're looking for support to help your child adapt, connect, and communicate with confidence, you're in the right place. Even if language learning has been a challenge in the past, know that patience, encouragement, and a gentle approach are at the heart of everything I do.</p>
                <p>Every child deserves a space where they feel safe to learn, make mistakes, and grow. I'm excited to help your child build their own "safe haven" and truly thrive here in the Netherlands.</p>

                        <p>Sessions blend playful Dutch learning with gentle emotional well-being support.
