                    <p>Hoi! Ik ben Florian.</p>
                    <p>I have a deep passion for teaching Dutch, particularly to highly educated adults and expat children living in the Netherlands.</p>
                    <p>My teaching approach revolves around interactive and experiential learning, taking place in the real world, outside and face-to-face. Rather than simply being a teacher, my goal is to act as a coach and mentor, guiding each individual towards their language goals. It is through this personalized approach that true magic happens.</p>
                    <p>We all need a safe and supportive environment to step out of our comfort zones and practice speaking Dutch. The concept of home is personal&mdash;for many, it is the feeling of belonging. My mission is to cultivate that feeling wherever you are.</p>

            <div class="slide-up" style="margin-bottom:2rem;">
                <p>You may be wondering how I can empathize with the feeling of not belonging. I spent part of my life abroad, living in places like Kinshasa, Bangkok, and Berlin. Returning to the Netherlands, I felt like a foreigner in my own country. Over time, I discovered that my experiences equipped me with the empathy and social skills to connect with people from all walks of life.</p>
                <p>Grounding myself again taught me that a true sense of home comes from safety, identity, and belonging. Building those foundations takes time, and that's where my coaching can help.</p>
                <p>If you plan to stay in the Netherlands and want to create a genuine home here, welcome! Even if languages have been challenging for you in the past, I'll meet you with patience and encouragement. Everyone deserves a space where mistakes are handled with gentleness.</p>
                <p>Let's embark on this journey together&mdash;quite literally. I incorporate physical movement and real-life experiences in my sessions. Many students love our Walking Coaching in Groningen, where we confront fears and unlock new growth.</p>

                <p>Your child&rsquo;s well-being is my top priority. I hold a current VOG (Dutch certificate of good conduct) and First Aid certification for children. I also keep parents in the loop and treat any information you share with care and respect.</p>
