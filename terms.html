                    <h2 id="section1">1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Safe Haven Dutch Coaching ("I", "my", "me") provides Dutch-language coaching and related services. By engaging my services, you ("you", "the Client") accept these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Where the Client is a minor, a parent or legal guardian accepts on the minor's behalf.</p>

                    <h2 id="section2">2. Our Services</h2>
                    <p>I offer Dutch language coaching blended with cultural-integration activities, tailored especially for Third Culture Kids (TCKs) and relocating families.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Delivery modes:</strong> primarily <strong>in-person</strong> at your home or my Groningen studio. Online sessions are offered only <strong>by mutual agreement</strong> (e.g., relocation credit in § 13, illness reschedule).</li>
                        <li><strong>Formats:</strong> one-to-one, sibling, small group (2–3 learners), whole-family practice, and guided cultural outings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Digital support:</strong> weekly PDF phrase sheets, 1–2-minute mini-videos, and WhatsApp voice-note feedback (responses within 24h during office hours, Mon-Fri 09:00 – 18:00 CET).</li>
                        <li><strong>Progress reports:</strong> milestone updates for parents.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="tos-section-minor-heading">No guarantee of specific results</h3>
                    <p>Every learner progresses at their own pace. I cannot promise particular exam scores, levels, or timelines.</p>
                    <h3 class="tos-section-minor-heading">Third-party tools disclaimer</h3>
                    <p>I rely on services such as Zoom, WhatsApp, Google Drive and Stripe. While I choose reputable providers, I am not liable for their outages or data breaches beyond my control.</p>

                    <h2 id="section3">3. Eligibility & Parental Consent</h2>
                    <p>Children under 16 require written parental consent via my intake form. Parents/guardians must share relevant learning, medical or behavioural information that may affect planning or child safety.</p>

                    <h2 id="section4">4. Booking, Cancellation & Rescheduling</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free intake & demo:</strong> no-obligation session to assess fit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Packages:</strong> e.g. <em>Foundation Package</em> (8 weeks, 22 contact hrs). <strong>50% deposit</strong> secures start date; balance due Week 4. One hold of up to <strong>14 days</strong> permitted with ≥ 7 days' notice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> rolling monthly (<em>Consolidation Subscription</em>). Billed in advance; pause or cancel with <strong>2 weeks' notice</strong>. One 2-week pause allowed every 3 months.</li>
                        <li><strong>Client change window:</strong>

                                <li>≥ 24 h notice – free reschedule or full refund.</li>
                                <li><24h notice – charged in full <strong>except</strong> each package (and every rolling 3-month subscription period) includes <strong>one courtesy late-reschedule</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Illness exception:</strong> provide a same-day doctor's note or positive test photo and I will reschedule at no cost (does not use the courtesy late-reschedule).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Coach cancellation:</strong> free reschedule or full refund.</li>
                        <li><strong>No-shows & late arrivals:</strong> session ends at the scheduled time and is charged in full.</li>
                        <li><strong>Holiday calendar:</strong> no sessions on Dutch national holidays or during my summer break (weeks 29-30). Dates published each January.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="section5">5. Fees & Payment</h2>
                    <p>Current rates are always published on my <strong>Price List</strong> at <a href="https://safehavendutch.nl/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://safehavendutch.nl/pricing</a> (the "Price List"), which forms part of these Terms. All amounts are in euros and indicate whether they are VAT-exempt under Art. 11(1)(o) Wet OB 1968 (private tuition in a school subject).</p>
                    <h3 id="section5_1">5.1 Price changes</h3>
                    <p>I review my Price List <strong>twice each calendar year</strong> to reflect inflation, using the most recent <strong>CBS Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong> as published by Statistics Netherlands. New prices take effect on <strong>1 February</strong> and <strong>1 August</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Packages</strong> – once your deposit is received, the fee shown on the Price List is locked for that package, even if a rise occurs before the package ends.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monthly subscriptions</strong> – revised rates apply from the next invoice issued on or after the effective date. I will email you at least <strong>30 days before</strong> the new rate applies; you may cancel without penalty before it takes effect.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="section5_2">5.2 Payment methods</h3>
                    <p>I accept credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, iDEAL, SEPA bank transfer (Bankoverschrijving), Bancontact, Giropay, Sofort, and Klarna.</p>
                    <h3 id="section5_3">5.3 Late payment</h3>
                    <p>Invoices overdue by 14 days accrue interest at <strong>1% per month</strong> plus reasonable collection costs.</p>

                    <h2 id="section6">6. Additional Participants & Group Conversion</h2>
                    <p>Inviting extra learners to a one-to-one session converts it to a group session. A surcharge <strong>equal to 50% of the base hourly rate per extra participant</strong> applies and must be paid in advance. Pre-booked <strong>'whole-family' sessions listed on the Price List are exempt from this surcharge</strong>. Requests must be made ≥ 24 h beforehand.</p>

                    <h2 id="section7">7. Travel Expenses</h2>
                    <p>Travel within Groningen city limits is included. Beyond that, <strong>€0.35/km round-trip</strong>, rounded to the nearest 5 km (one fee per visit).</p>

                    <h2 id="section8">8. Parent Updates & Safeguarding</h2>
                    <p>I provide brief notes after each session and fuller written reports at programme phases. All staff hold a <strong>VOG</strong> (Verklaring Omtrent Gedrag) and follow Dutch child-protection rules. A responsible adult must be present in the home during sessions unless a written waiver is signed <strong>by the parent or legal guardian who accepted these Terms</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 id="section9">9. Privacy, Data & Recording</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data collected:</strong> contact details, intake forms, session notes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose & lawful basis:</strong> service delivery, legitimate interest in programme improvement, legal compliance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> 3 years after programme completion, then deletion or anonymisation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recordings:</strong> sessions <strong>are not recorded</strong> unless I obtain separate written consent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookies & analytics:</strong> my website uses cookies and comparable tech; see my <strong>Cookie Policy</strong> for details.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data processors & transfers:</strong> data are stored in the EEA and may transit through vetted third-party services listed above.</li>
                        <li>I never share personal data without consent, in accordance with the <strong>GDPR</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="section10">10. Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <p>All lesson materials, videos and resources remain my intellectual property. I grant you a non-transferable licence for personal educational use. Reproduction or commercial use requires written permission.</p>

                    <h2 id="section11">11. Liability</h2>
                    <p>I do <strong>not</strong> currently carry professional liability or general business insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by Dutch law, my total liability for any claim is limited to (i) the fee actually paid and <strong>un-utilised</strong> for the current or most recently completed package, prorated if the package ends early, <strong>or</strong> (ii) four (4) weeks of my standard subscription fee, whichever is lower. I am not liable for indirect or consequential damages.</p>

                    <h2 id="section12">12. Termination</h2>
                    <p>I may terminate services with immediate effect if you materially breach these Terms (e.g. harassment, non-payment > 14 days). All outstanding fees remain payable. You may terminate at any time subject to the cancellation rules in §4.</p>

                    <h2 id="section13">13. Unused Hours & Relocation</h2>
                    <p>Relocating outside NL? Unused prepaid hours convert to <strong>online-only credit</strong> valid 6 months; no cash refund.</p>

                    <h2 id="section14">14. Force Majeure</h2>
                    <p>Neither party is liable for non-performance caused by events beyond reasonable control (extreme weather, illness, internet outage). Affected sessions will be rescheduled in good faith.</p>

                    <h2 id="section15">15. Governing Law, Disputes & EU ODR</h2>
                    <p>These Terms are governed by Dutch law. Parties will first seek informal resolution. Failing that, disputes go to the competent court in Amsterdam unless mandatory law dictates otherwise. Consumers may also use the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a></p>

                    <h2 id="section16">16. Miscellaneous</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Severability:</strong> if any provision is held invalid, the rest remain in force.</li>
                        <li><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> these Terms and my Privacy & Cookie Policies form the entire agreement between us, superseding prior discussions.</li>
                        <li><strong>No waiver:</strong> failure to enforce any right does not waive future enforcement.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="section17">17. Amendments</h2>
                    <p>I may update these Terms. Material changes are e-mailed at least 14 days in advance. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>
