                     <h3>Hallo! Ik ben Florian.</h3>
                     <p>I’m the heart behind Safe Haven Dutch Coaching — a personalized language and integration service designed especially for expat and Third Culture Kid (TCK) children living in Groningen.</p>
                     <p>After years of teaching Dutch to adults, I’ve refocused my mission on the ones who often need it most: international children adjusting to a new life, language, and school system. My goal is simple — to help your child not only learn Dutch, but truly feel at home here.</p>

                     <p>Learning Dutch shouldn't feel like a chore — especially not for kids. My sessions are built around playful, interactive, real-world learning, tailored to each child’s age, language level, and personality.</p>
                     <p>Think: baking Dutch cookies while learning verbs, role-playing playground conversations, or going on cultural outings where the language comes to life. I don’t just teach vocabulary — I coach children in confidence, communication, and connection.</p>

                     <p>Grounding myself in the Netherlands taught me that home isn’t just a place — it’s a feeling of safety, identity, and belonging.</p>
                     <p>That’s what I want to give your child. Every session is designed not only to teach Dutch, but to build resilience, emotional safety, and social ease. Whether your child is new to the country, starting Dutch school, or somewhere in between, we provide the soft landing they need to adapt and grow.</p>

                     <p>Safe Haven Dutch Coaching blends NT2 language learning with emotional and social integration — all rooted in a gentle, child-centered coaching philosophy.</p>
                     <p>Inspired by a holistic view of well-being, I focus on nurturing each child’s inner confidence, language fluency, and sense of connection — in a way that respects all cultural backgrounds and honors the whole child.</p>
                     <p class="disclaimer">Please note: Our coaching provides educational and emotional support and is not a substitute for therapy. We focus on language acquisition, cultural integration, and fostering well-being within an educational context. If deeper concerns arise, I always refer to licensed professionals.</p>

                     <p>At Safe Haven Dutch Coaching, your child’s safety and well-being are really important to me. I work with clear boundaries, keep parents in the loop, and do everything I can to create a space that feels safe and supportive. I have a current VOG (Dutch certificate of good conduct) and First Aid certification for children, so I’m prepared if anything unexpected happens.</p>
                     <p>I also take privacy seriously. Any info you share is stored safely and only used with your permission. It’s all about building trust — so you and your child can feel at ease from day one.</p>

Florian was always supportive and patient and now she is thriving with her newly achieved Dutch skills. As parents, we found critical to expose her to Dutch so she could speak with friends at school. She felt so confident with her Dutch teaching that now she does German as her second language. She never doubted her new skills achieved thanks to Florian. Thank you so much!"</p>

                                <p class="quote">"Florian has a thoughtful and professional approach to Dutch Lessons for young children. When my daughter began lessons with Florian, she had no knowledge of Dutch, either in speaking or understanding. She quickly grew to love his lessons and eagerly looked forward to them each week. Florian took the time to personalize his lesson plans to match her unique needs. His own experience as an international in a foreign country gave him valuable insight into the challenges she faces as a young international student. After just a few lessons, her Dutch improved so much that she started making more Dutch friends at school. We greatly appreciate his professionalism and his gentle, thoughtful approach to teaching young children."</p>
